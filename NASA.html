<h1> Unlocking The Secrets Of The Sun </h1>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/MhcwhTQ/thesun.jpg" alt="thesun" border="0"></a>
<h3><u> Intro </u></h3>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> Scientists have wondered for decades about the origins, properties, and influence of the solar wind in all its forms (fast, slow, and transient) – especially as it speeds through the solar system toward interstellar space. Technology and techniques have finally come together to enable missions like Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter that are designed to study the Sun closer than ever before, with durable spacecraft fortified to perform investigations in hazardous regions of intense heat and solar radiation. Parker Solar Probe, for example, will fly close enough to the Sun to observe the young and pristine solar wind within its acceleration zone, and will fly through the birthplace of the highest-energy solar particles. </p>

<h3><u> Our Goal </u></h3>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> The purpose of this website is to help improve your knowledge of the many spacecrafts exploring the sun. Hopefully by providing useful and interesting information , we can encoourage you to invest in the future of exploration and come up with new innovative ideas .</p>

<h3><u>What is Heliophysics?</u></h3>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic">Heliophysics is the physics of the Sun and its connection with Solar System. NASA defines heliophysics as "1)the comprehensive new term for the science of the Sun - Solar Connection and 2)the exploration , discovery and understanding of Earth's space enviroment and 3)the system science that unites all of the linked phenomena in the region of the cosmos influenced by a star like our Sun." We will go more in depth on two recent heliophysics expeditions , The Parker Solar Probe and The Solar Orbiter.</p>

<h2> Parker Solar Probe </h2>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/98c4z07/PSB.jpg" alt="PSB" border="0"></a>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> Their is over 20 active space missions helping us to understand the connection between the Sun and Earth and of those missions , NASA's Parker Solar Probe is arguably the most exciting!</p>

<h3><u> The Mission </u></h3>
<a href="https://ibb.co/d0qCRBC"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1f5ykZy/Pre-Launch-PSB.jpg" alt="Pre-Launch-PSB" border="0"></a><p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> The Parker Solar Probe will swoop within 4 million miles of the Suns's surface while facing heat and radiation like no other spacecraft has endured.The probe was launched on August 12th 2018 and will provide new data on solar activity and make critical contributions to our ability to forecast major space-weather events that impact your life on planet Earth.</p>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic" > Here is a video of the launch</p>
<div style="padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/621081047?h=059f01f412&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="PSBLaunch.mp4"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

<h3><u> The Goals Of The Probe </u> </h3>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> 1.Tracing the flow of energy that accelerates and heats the solar wind</p>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> 2.Figuring out the structure and the behaviour of the plasma magnetic fields at the source of the solar wind.<p>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> 3.Looking at what accelerates and transports the hazardous energetic particles</p>

<h3><u>The Trajectory Design and Current Position of the Parker Solar Probe</u></h3>
<a href="https://ibb.co/xj8MxFY"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/d2JQ8mt/PSBTraj.png" alt="PSBTraj" border="0"></a>

<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> The proposed trajectory was for the Parker Solar Probe will use seven Venus flybys over nearly seven years to gradually shrink its orbit around the Sun, coming as close as 3.83 million miles (and 6.16 million kilometers) to the Sun, well within the orbit of Mercury and about seven times closer than any spacecraft has come before.<br> After its launch , the first Venus Flyby occured on the 8th of October 2018 and then the first Perihelion(the point in the orbit of a planet, asteroid, or comet at which it is closest to the sun.) occured almost a month later on the 6th of November 2018.<br> In the above picture you can see the current position of the Parker Solar Probe as of October 2021 and on the 16th of October ,it  is scheduled to complete its 5th Venus Flyby.</p>

<h2> The Solar Orbiter </h2>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/qpZqpf0/SO.jpg" alt="SO" border="0"></a>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> The Solar Orbiter is said to be one of the most complex scientific labratory ever to be sent to the Sun. The Solar Orbiter first launched in February of 2020 and plans to begin routine science operations in November of this year. Solar Orbiter will take images of the Sun from closer than any spacecraft before and for the first time look at its uncharted polar regions.<br> Below is a video of the launch of the Solar Orbiter</p>
<div style="padding:75% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/621082617?h=c62e49fea7&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="SOLaunch.mp4"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

<h3><u> What Are We Hoping To Solve?</u></h3>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> Well by combining observations from the Solar Orbiter's six remote-sensing instruments and four sets in situ instruments , scientists hope to find answers to some profound questions. <br>
	1. What drives the Sun’s 11-year cycle of rising and subsiding magnetic activity? <br>
	2. What heats up the upper layer of its atmosphere, the corona, to millions of degrees Celsius?<br>
	3. What drives the generation of the solar wind?<br>
	4. What accelerates the solar wind to speeds of hundreds of kilometres per second? <br>
	5. And how does it all affect our planet? <br></p>

<h3><u> Mission Highlights </u></h3>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> The closest the Solar Orbiter has come to the sun is 42 million kilometres.<br> The closest ever images of the Sun , the first ever close-up images of the Sun's polar regions , measuring the composition of the solar wind and linking it to its area of origin on the Sun's surface. Below you will see the images that were taken by the Solar Orbiter.

<h2><u> What is The Future Of Heliophysics?</u> </h2>
<p style = "color:tomato; font-style:italic"> Well the future of heliophysics lies with us!! The thrill of developing a mission as Parker Solar Probe has emboldened the science community and raised its aspirations. NASA launched the Heliophysics 2050 program to extend the vision and goals for missions and science by 2050 and beyond! I implore you to think about the future of solar exploration as the things that we learn from these missions have an important impact on our lives. I only have one question to ask you to end this.....
</p>
<p style = "color: white;"><b> What would a future mission conducted by you look like and what aspects of the Sun would it explore?</b></p>
